<p>Hey <%= @user_1.first_name %> and <%= @user_2.first_name %>,</p>
<p>
  Thanks for taking the time to have a conversation. I'll leave it up to you two to find a time for
  <% if @locations[0][:city] == @locations[1][:city] %>
    a video chat, or even an in-person conversation â€“ both of you are in <%= @locations[0][:city] %>.
  <% else %>
    a video chat or phone call. I highly recommend the video chat!
    <% if @locations[0][:time_zone] && @locations[1][:time_zone] %>
      <% if @locations[0][:time_zone] == @locations[1][:time_zone] %>
        You're both in the <%= @locations[0][:time_zone_nice] %> time zone, which is awesome!
      <% else %>
        Watch out, one of you is in the <%= @locations[0][:time_zone_nice] %> time zone, and the other is in <%= @locations[1][:time_zone_nice] %>.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
  <% end %>
</p>
<p>
  You can find conversation guide I put together to help get you started <a href="https://www.hifromtheotherside.com/guide">here</a>.

<p>I'll follow up in about a week to see how it went!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Henry</p>
